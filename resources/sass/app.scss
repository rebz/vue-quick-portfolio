/*
 *  Methodologies for this Project
 *
 *
 *  ITCSS
 *  https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/
 *
 *  Stands for Inverted Triangle CSS and it helps you to organize your
 *  project CSS files in such way that you can better deal with
 *  (not always easy-to-deal with) CSS specifics like global
 *  namespace, cascade and selectors specificity.
 *
 *
 *  BEM
 *  http://getbem.com/introduction/
 *
 *  Stands for Block Element Modifier and helps to avoid inheritance,
 *  provides some sort of scope by using unique CSS classes per
 *  element (like .Button__icon--active), and reduces style
 *  conflicts by keeping CSS specificity to a minimum level.
